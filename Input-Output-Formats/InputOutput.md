# Input and Output Formats
* For all input and configuration files in Biofilter, lines beginning with the symbol "`#`" will be ignored. This is useful for
placing comments within input files that will not be a part of the analysis.

## Configuration Files (not required)
* This example configuration file was generated by the `REPORT_CONFIGURATION` option, with
everything else left at default values:
```
# Biofilter configuration file

# Biofilter version 2.1.0 (2013-07-18)

* Any option which can be used on the command line can also be used in a configuration file. Each option
must appear as the first item on a line, and any arguments to that option must be separated by `whitespace`
(any number of tabs or spaces).

* If an argument to an option must itself contain spaces (for example a multi-word gene or group
identifier), the argument may be enclosed with `“`double quotes`”` to prevent the additional words in the
argument from being interpreted as a separate arguments. If an argument must itself contain double
quotes, they must be escaped with a backslash, `\`”like so`\`”.

* There is also one extra option which may only be used in a configuration file: `INCLUDE`. This option
requires one or more filename arguments and causes Biofilter to read each specified file as an additional
configuration file. Included files are processed in full before any other options in the original
configuration file. For example, if file A includes file B and both files specify the same option, then the
option’s setting or value from file A will always override the one from file B, even if it appears before
the `INCLUDE` instruction. Included configuration files may also include further files; there is no limit to
this recursion, except that any loops (i.e. A includes B which includes A) will raise an error.
