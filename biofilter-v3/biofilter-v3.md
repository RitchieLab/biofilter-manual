Via Biofilter 3.0, researchers can additionally:

* Annotate genomic location or region-based data (such as results from association studies) with relevant immunological knowledge
* Filter genomic location data based on immunological criteria, such as filtering a series of SNPs to retain those present in specific genes within immune-related pathways
* Easily annotate a list of thousands of genes or proteins (derived from immune assays) based on key terms, pathways, and/or diseases of interest
* Filter and annotate results based on known gene-disease associations (i.e. autoimmune diseases)
* Generate predictive models for interaction pairs (gene-gene, SNP-SNP, or CNV-CNV) based on prior immunological information
